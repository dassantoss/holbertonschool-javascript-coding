# JavaScript - Web Scraping Amateur

## Description

This project introduces you to web scraping using JavaScript. It's designed for beginners and covers fundamental concepts of web scraping and data manipulation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand why JavaScript programming is amazing.
- Manipulate JSON data effectively.
- Use the request and fetch API for web scraping.
- Read and write files using the fs module.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using Node.js (version 10.14.x).
- Ensure that all your files end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should be semistandard compliant (Rules of Standard + semicolons on top). You can also refer to the AirBnB style.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- Avoid using `var`.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js 10:

```bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

```bash
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global

```bash
$ sudo npm install request --global
$ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules

Notes: The request module has been deprecated since February 2020, but it's still a simple and powerful module for practicing web scraping in JavaScript.
